# Material UI GraphQL App

This is a web application built using Material UI and GraphQL, Redux, ContextAPI technologies, designed to provide a modern and responsive user interface for interacting with GraphQL APIs.

## Features:

- **Material UI Components**: The app leverages the power of Material UI to create a sleek and intuitive user interface. Material UI's pre-designed components help maintain consistency and usability across the application.

- **GraphQL Integration**: Utilizing GraphQL, the app efficiently fetches and manages data from various sources. GraphQL's flexible querying capabilities enable optimized data retrieval, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

- **Redux State Management**: Implementing Redux for state management, the app maintains a centralized store for managing application state. Redux facilitates predictable state management and helps organize application logic.

- **Redux Toolkit**: Utilizing Redux Toolkit, the app benefits from simplified Redux setup and improved developer experience. Redux Toolkit provides utilities for writing concise and efficient Redux code, reducing boilerplate and complexity.

- **Context API**: Leveraging the Context API, the app efficiently shares state across components without prop drilling. Context API enables components to access shared data and functionality without relying on intermediate components.

- **Jest Testing**: Implementing Jest for testing, the app ensures code reliability and robustness through automated testing. Jest provides a comprehensive testing framework for writing unit tests, integration tests, and snapshot tests.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring seamless user experience across devices of different screen sizes. Whether accessed on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices, the app adapts its layout and components to fit the screen dimensions.

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Through dynamic data visualization components, users can interact with data in meaningful ways. Charts, graphs, and tables provide insights into the underlying data, enhancing user understanding and decision-making.

- **Modular Architecture**: The app follows a modular architecture, promoting code reusability and maintainability. Components are organized into logical modules, facilitating easier development, testing, and debugging.

- **Customization Options**: Users have the ability to customize their experience through configurable settings and preferences. This flexibility empowers users to tailor the application to their specific needs and preferences.

- **GraphQL API Integration**: The app seamlessly integrates with GraphQL APIs to fetch and update data in real-time. GraphQL's subscription model enables the app to receive live updates, keeping data synchronized across clients.

## Technologies Used:

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material UI**: React component library implementing Google's Material Design.
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs, providing a more efficient alternative to REST.
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL client for fetching and caching data from GraphQL APIs.
- **Redux**: Predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **Context API**: React's built-in state management solution for sharing state across components.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.

## Installation and Usage:

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn: `npm install` or `yarn`.
3. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
4. Access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
5. For Apollo Server go directory api and Install dependencies using npm or yarn: `npm install` or `yarn`.
6. Start the development server: `node server.js`.
7. Access the ApolloServer in your web browser at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
